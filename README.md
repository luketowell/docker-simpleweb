# Simple Web App

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is as a learning point for combining docker to run a nodeJS application within a docker container. The code has been produced from the Stephen Grinder course available [here](https://www.udemy.com/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/).

### Docker
I have chosen the alpine image so that we could use the most basic version of node with no addons


command to build and run the docker container - ```docker build .```
### Node
The Node application is a simple application which runs a server listening on port 3000 and when you hit ```localhost:3000``` will return "Hello There!".
